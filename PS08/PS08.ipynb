    "I feel not comfortable having a judge to use COMPAS to inform sentencing guidelines. Given the data and the study by Kleinberg et al., it seems that the use of COMPAS or similar predictive tools could potentially improve outcomes in the criminal justice system. However, this does not come without concerns. In the context of recidivism prediction, a high FPR means that a significant number of individuals who did not recidivate were predicted to do so, potentially leading to unnecessary interventions or restrictions. A high FNR means that a significant number of individuals who did recidivate were not predicted to do so, indicating missed opportunities for interventions that might have prevented recidivism. There is a higher percentage of people who are predicted not recidivate but recidivate than the percentage of people are predicted recidivate but not recidivate. Falsely predicted the person who recidivate will be more harmful than falsely predicted the person who will not recidivate. The error rates in classification, and the potential for these errors to result in unfair outcomes, is a significant issue. Additionally, there are broader concerns about transparency and potential biases in the algorithm. So, while there could be benefits, it's crucial that such tools are used with a clear understanding of their limitations and with safeguards in place to prevent unfair treatment. "

On one hand, the study by Kleinberg et al. suggests that machine learning tools like COMPAS might potentially outperform human judges in certain respects, for instance, in minimizing jail populations without increasing crime rates. On the other hand, the study also notes that judges might consider a broader set of variables than what the algorithm focuses on although judeges may also have some personal bias, indicating that human decision-making may have advantages in capturing complex, multifaceted considerations.

From a purely numerical perspective, the rates for both high-risk and low-risk groups are not identical, but the difference in both cases is the same (6 percentage points). However, when it comes to the question of racial disparity and fairness, it's important to consider these rates in the context of the larger social, historical, and systemic factors that can influence recidivism. The COMPAS system is predicting more African-Americans to be high-risk compared to Caucasians, and these groups actually have a similar risk of recidivism, this could potentially be a sign of racial bias in the system. It implies the Caucasians is favored. is could be seen as a violation of the concept of group fairness, which requires that similar groups (in terms of the outcome of interest) are treated similarly by the system. On the other hand, the concept of individual fairness requires that similar individuals are treated similarly. If African-Americans who are similar to Caucasians in terms of their risk factors for recidivism are being more frequently or harshly labeled as high-risk by COMPAS, this could be seen as a violation of individual fairness."

    "Accuracy refers to the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) in the total number of cases examined. In this case, COMPAS has a slightly higher accuracy for Caucasians (67.2%) than for African-Americans (64.9%). This difference, while not large, suggests that COMPAS's predictions are slightly more likely to be correct for Caucasians. The false positive rate (FPR) refers to the proportion of negative events that are incorrectly classified as positive. Here, the false positive rate is much higher for African-Americans (42.3%) than for Caucasians (22%). This means that African-Americans are much more likely to be incorrectly labeled as high risk (recidivist) by COMPAS compared to Caucasians. The false negative rate (FNR) refers to the proportion of positive events that are incorrectly classified as negative. In this case, the false negative rate is higher for Caucasians (49.6%) than for African-Americans (28.5%). This means that Caucasians are more likely to be incorrectly labeled as low risk (non-recidivist) by COMPAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different rates of false positives and false negatives can have significant real-world impacts. A high false positive rate for African-Americans could lead to unjust outcomes, such as unnecessary incarceration or harsher sentences. Conversely, a high false negative rate for Caucasians could mean that individuals who pose a higher risk of reoffending are not being appropriately identified and managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these disparities in false positive and false negative rates, we can argue that the COMPAS algorithm is not fair, even though its overall accuracy is similar for both groups. This is because the algorithm's errors disproportionately impact different racial groups in different ways, which can contribute to systemic biases and inequalities. However, it's also worth noting that the COMPAS algorithm is not solely responsible for these disparities. The algorithm is trained on historical data, which can reflect and perpetuate existing biases in the criminal justice system. Therefore, addressing these issues may require broader systemic changes, in addition to improving the fairness of predictive algorithms like COMPAS."

    "Yes, my answer to this question aligns with the answer provided in question 2. The key point in both answers is that there are observed disparities in the COMPAS algorithm's predictions across different racial groups, but these disparities alone do not necessarily mean the algorithm is unfair. In question 2, I mentioned that the COMPAS system shows higher recidivism rates for African-Americans compared to Caucasians in both low-risk and high-risk groups. However, I also pointed out that these differences could be due to a wide range of factors, including socioeconomic factors, systemic discrimination, or differences in policing practices, among others. Similarly, in this question, I noted that the COMPAS algorithm shows different false positive and false negative rates for African-Americans and Caucasians, but this does not automatically mean the algorithm is unfair. The algorithm's errors disproportionately impact different racial groups, but these errors may be reflecting existing biases in the criminal justice system rather than biases inherent in the algorithm itself. In both cases, the key issue is not just the presence of disparities, but the reasons behind these disparities and their real-world impacts. As I mentioned in both answers, determining whether the COMPAS algorithm is \"fair\" requires a more nuanced understanding of these issues. The recommended readings by Kleinberg et al. discuss the complexities of defining fairness in algorithms. They highlight that there can be inherent trade-offs in trying to make an algorithm fair according to different definitions of fairness. For example, an algorithm might be fair in terms of its overall accuracy across different groups, but unfair in terms of its false positive or false negative rates. This is a reflection of the fact that fairness is a multifaceted concept, and achieving fairness according to one definition can sometimes lead to unfairness according to another definition. In conclusion, the question of whether the COMPAS algorithm is fair cannot be definitively answered based solely on the observed disparities. It requires a deeper understanding of the causes and impacts of these disparities, as well as a thoughtful consideration of what we mean by \"fairness\" in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to consider the concept of fairness in algorithmic decision-making often revolves around two main paradigms: individual fairness and group fairness. Individual fairness requires that similar individuals are treated similarly. In the context of the COMPAS algorithm, this would mean that two individuals with similar criminal histories and other relevant characteristics should have similar recidivism risk scores, regardless of their race. Group fairness, on the other hand, requires that certain outcomes are balanced across different demographic groups. In this context, it could mean that the rates of false positives and false negatives in recidivism predictions should be approximately equal for African-Americans and Caucasians. The contradiction between individual and group fairness can be seen in the results I presented above. The COMPAS algorithm may be relatively fair from an individual fairness perspective, as it has similar accuracy rates for African-Americans and Caucasians. This suggests that it treats similar individuals similarly, at least in terms of its overall predictive accuracy. However, the algorithm appears to be less fair from a group fairness perspective, as it has significantly different false positive and false negative rates for African-Americans and Caucasians. This means that the errors it makes are not equally distributed across these two groups, which can lead to systemic biases and unfair outcomes.This contradiction underscores the inherent complexities and trade-offs in achieving algorithmic fairness. Depending on how we define fairness, the same algorithm can be seen as both fair and unfair. It also highlights the need for a careful and nuanced approach to developing and evaluating predictive algorithms like COMPAS, with a focus on both individual and group fairness."

    "The F-score is a performance metric that considers both precision (P) and recall (R), which makes it a balanced measure when I care equally about both of these aspects. In the context of predicting recidivism, precision would be the proportion of individuals who actually reoffended among all those predicted to reoffend, while recall would be the proportion of individuals who reoffended and were correctly predicted to do so out of all individuals who actually reoffended. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it tends towards the smaller value of the two. This means that a good F1-score requires both good precision and good recall. On the other hand, the Accuracy (A) might not be a good measure in this case if the classes are imbalanced (i.e., if there are many more non-recidivists than recidivists). Accuracy could be high just by predicting the majority class. The False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) are useful for examining specific types of errors. For instance, if it's much worse to incorrectly predict that someone will reoffend when they won't (false positive), I would want a low FPR. If it's much worse to incorrectly predict that someone won't reoffend when they will (false negative), I would want a low FNR. By focusing on the F1-score, I am implicitly assuming that these two types of errors are equally bad, which might not be the case."

The exact formula used to calculate the decile score is proprietary information owned by Northpointe, the company that created COMPAS. This means it's not possible to fully understand how the score is calculated, which factors are considered, and how much weight is given to each factor. This lack of transparency can make it difficult to validate the accuracy, fairness, or bias of the score. Including it as a feature in my model would introduce that same lack of transparency and potential bias. I want my model to be independent and to rely on its own features. Relying heavily on the decile score might result in overlooking other important factors in a person's situation or background that aren't captured by the COMPAS algorithm."

    "#### 4. Experiment with different models to find the best model according to your performance indicator. Try trees and k-NN, you may also include other types of models. Include/exclude different variables. You may also do feature engineering, e.g. create a different set of age groups, include variables like age2, age3, interaction effects, etc. But do not include race and gender.Report what did you try (no need to report the full results of all of your unsuccessful attempts), and your best model’s performance. Did you got better results or worse results than COMPAS?"

    "**Group Fairness:** Group fairness looks at the equality of outcomes across different demographic groups. In this case, group fairness would mean that the recidivism rates for low-risk and high-risk scores should be similar for both African-Americans and Caucasians in each model. In the COMPAS model, the recidivism rate for low-risk African-Americans is 35.14%, and for low-risk Caucasians, it's 28.99%. The difference is 6.15 percentage points. For high-risk scores, the recidivism rate is 64.95% for African-Americans and 59.48% for Caucasians, a difference of 5.47 percentage points. In my model, the recidivism rate for low-risk African-Americans is 33.87%, and for low-risk Caucasians, it's 29.9%, a difference of 3.97 percentage points. For high-risk scores, the recidivism rate is 68.77% for African-Americans and 63.32% for Caucasians, a difference of 5.45 percentage points. From the perspective of group fairness, my model shows a smaller disparity in recidivism rates for low-risk scores between the two races compared to the COMPAS model, which could indicate that my model is more fair in this aspect. The disparity for high-risk scores is nearly the same in both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual Fairness:** Individual fairness suggests that similar individuals should receive similar outcomes. This would mean that two individuals with similar criminal histories and other relevant characteristics should receive similar risk scores, regardless of their race. Since individual fairness focuses on the treatment of similar individuals, it's harder to evaluate from the provided aggregate data. However, based on the data we do have, both models are consistent in that individuals labeled as high-risk have a higher rate of recidivism than those labeled as low-risk. The larger gap in recidivism rates between low-risk and high-risk individuals in my model could suggest that it is more effective at identifying individuals who are truly at a higher risk of recidivism. However, this would need to be confirmed with more detailed, individual-level data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, my model appears to show slightly better group fairness for low-risk scores, while both models are similar in terms of high-risk scores. Individual fairness is harder to evaluate, but both models show consistent patterns. "

This means my model may be more likely to underestimate the risk of recidivism for African-Americans and Caucasians, potentially overlooking individuals who may benefit from interventions. We do not have treatment information here, but we can see that given the score AA-s have higher re-offence probabilities. So There are good arguments for not treating similar individuals in a similar manner. From a individual fairness perspective, compas model appears to be more fair."

    "**Group Fairness:** My model seems to perform better than COMPAS in terms of group fairness. This is indicated by the smaller disparity in recidivism rates between different racial groups (African-Americans and Caucasians) in my model compared to COMPAS. In particular, my model has a lower False Positive Rate (FPR) for both African-Americans and Caucasians and a smaller disparity in FPR between these groups compared to COMPAS. This is a positive aspect of group fairness as it suggests that my model is less likely to unfairly label individuals as high risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Individual Fairness:** The results are more nuanced from the perspective of individual fairness. While my model generally maintains a consistent trend in that individuals labeled as high risk have a higher rate of recidivism than those labeled as low risk, there's a potential concern that my model might be underestimating the risk of recidivism for African-Americans and Caucasians (as indicated by a higher False Negative Rate, FNR, for African-Americans and Caucasians in my model compared to COMPAS). This could mean that individuals who could benefit from interventions are being overlooked, which could be a challenge in terms of individual fairness.\n",

    "In conclusion, my model seems to be more fair than COMPAS in terms of group fairness, but faces some challenges in terms of individual fairness. "
