    "(1)Women and children first: The logistic regression results show that women had higher chances of survival compared to men. This is consistent with the widely reported policy of \"women and children first\" during the evacuation. However, the results regarding children are not statistically significant, which may suggest that the policy may not have been implemented consistently across all passengers.\n",

    "(2)Socio-economic status: The results show that passengers in higher classes (class 1) had better chances of survival than those in lower classes (classes 2 and 3). This could indicate that there was a certain level of social stratification during the evacuation, where wealthier passengers were given priority or had easier access to lifeboats.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)Age factor: The analysis indicates that younger passengers had higher chances of survival compared to older passengers. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including younger individuals being more physically able to reach lifeboats or withstand the harsh conditions after the sinking.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4)Order and breakdown: The results do not directly address whether the order broke down during the last hours on the Titanic. However, the fact that certain groups (e.g., women and passengers in higher classes) had higher survival chances might suggest that there was some level of organization during the evacuation process."
