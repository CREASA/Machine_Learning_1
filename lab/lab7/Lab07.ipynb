For this question, we need to consider about the situation of the Type 1 Errors(false Edible in this question).The cost or risk of a Type 1 error is really high in this problem (for instance, if incorrectly identifying something as edible but they are actually poisonous), then it would be sensible to choose a model that minimizes the chance of such errors.For Model 1, the false Edible value is 0 means that all the cases predict as edible are all edible in the reality and the false Edible number of that in M2 is 1 means that all the cases predict as edible are not all edible in the reality but contains one poisonous mushroom.It contains some poisonous cases that we didn't identify.

Model M4 didn't wrongly accuse any innocent individuals, so it would be a better choice for this reason.However, M4 also wrongly identified 3 guilty individuals as innocent (false negatives). This means some guilty people might go free. In contrast, M1 only wrongly identified 1 guilty person as innocent.So, the decision between M3 and M4 depends on which type of mistake is considered worse: accusing innocent people or letting guilty ones go free.If the primary goal is to avoid accusing innocent people at all costs, then M4 is better because it didn't make any such mistakes. But if the aim is to catch as many guilty people as possible, even if it means sometimes accusing innocent people, then M3 might be a better choice."

Notice that the models' true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative rates remain the same when comparing them to each other. It's just that we're now looking at them from the perspective of identifying innocent people instead of identifying guilty people.The decision on which model to use will depend on the values and priorities of the police department.

If maximizing the number of correctly identified innocent people is more important, M3 may be preferred."
