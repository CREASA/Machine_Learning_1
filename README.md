# Machine_Learning_1
## PS1
We are going with the basic python, such as creating and computing variables, and doing tricks with functions, lists and dicts.

## PS2
We analyze real data, the gapminder dataset of world development indicators. We check for missing values and certain inconsistencies in data, and do only basic descriptive statistical analysis. We also reveal about what this data implies, and linking it to historical events.

## PS3
We compute properties of different RV-s, and compare these with the corresponding sample propertie.

## PS4
We revolve around Central Limit Theorem, statistical hypotheses and confidence intervals.


## PS5
This problem set revolves around linear regression, in particular interpretation of linear regression results. It contains three parts:
1. Estimate a simple regression model and compute a few simple figures based on the results  
2. Estimate and understand a multiple regression model  
3. Interpret regression results in the literature  


## PS6
This problem set revolves around logistic regression and predictive modeling. Its main goals are
1. Learn to use and interpret logistic regression results
2. Learn to handle categorical variables
3. learn to predict the outcomes, and compare those with the actual data.
4. Compute and understand RMSE

## PS7
This PS has the following goals:
1. use sklearn library for predictive modeling
2. learn to predict the outcomes and probabilities
3. understand confusion matrix and related concepts
4. use different methods for predictive modeling
5. do 3-fold testing-validation-training workflow
In this question, we will construct a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a person having a heart attack. The dataset heart.csv comes from Kaggle:www.kaggle.com/rashikrahmanpritom/ heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset, which contains health information of each person (predictors) and whether or not the person had a heart attack before (outcome variable). 

## PS8
This problem set has the following goals:
1. Use confusion matrices to understand a recent controversy around racial equality and criminal justice system.
2. Use logistic regression skills to develop and validate a model, analogous to the proprietary COMPAS model that caused the above-mentioned controversy.
3. Give some hands-on experience with typical machine learning workflow, in particular model selection with cross-validation.
4. To think over the concept of fairness, and the role of statistical tools in the policymaking process.
